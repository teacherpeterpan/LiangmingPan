## Coffee Roasting

I drink a lot of coffee, and especially enjoy light roast espresso.
These lighter roasts allow the flavors of the different types of coffee
beans to stand out more.  Since 2009, I have been roasting my own coffee from
green coffee beans.  I started out using the oven, then later switched using
a series of home roasting machines.  Currently I am using a Behmor 1600.
My favorite coffee so far is an [Ecuador Organic Zamora], but I tend to
spend most of my time trying new types.

I love extremely spicy food and cooking. I taught myself cooking by trying
to reproduce spicy dishes I like and with the help of many friends who have
taught me dishes from their home countries. Recently I have been learning
Thai dishes.  I am always up to learn how to to cook a exotic new dish.

## Powerlifting

In my free time I do powerlifting to stay healthy.  While it has been a
number of years since I competed, I am actively training and go to the gym
3 to 5 times per week.  My current training maxes are 415lb squat, 275lb bench,
455lb deadlift.

## Past Hobbies

I previously enjoyed skiing, sailing, horseback riding, climbing, hiking,
and developing/playing computer games. However, I have not had time to do
any of these things recently.
