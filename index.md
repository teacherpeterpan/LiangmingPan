# About Me

<img src="/images/liangmingpan2.jpg" class="floatpic" width="300" height="300">
I am a first year PhD student at [NUS Graduate School for Integrative Sciences and Engineering (NGS)][NGS], [National University of Singapore][NUS]. 
I am associated with the [Web Information Retrieval / Natural Language Processing Group (WING)][WING] and jointly advised by Prof. [Min-Yen Kan][Min] and Prof. [Tat-Seng Chua][Chua]. 
<!--I am also interning at 6ESTATES, an AI company in Sigapore.-->
My research interests include knowledge base, natural language processing, and data mining. 
I am currently working on discovering research dynamics in scientific literature. 

Prior to joining NUS, I received my Master degree from [Tsinghua University][Tsinghua] under the guidance of Prof. [Juanzi Li][juanzili] and Prof. [Jie Tang][jietang] (2014 - 2017). 
My master's thesis is about data mining in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). 
Before that, I obtained my bachelor degree in [Beihang University][BUAA] (2010 - 2014).

My name is Liangming Pan. I am a research assistant in the Knowledge Engineering Lab (Group) at [Tsinghua University][Tsinghua] where I work with Prof. [Juanzi Li][juanzili] and Prof. [Jie Tang][jietang]. I received my Master degree from Tsinghua University under the guidance of Prof. Juanzi Li (2014 - 2017). And, before this, I was an undergraduate student at [Beihang University][BUAA] (2010 - 2014). 

When I was a master student, I devoted most of my time working with Prof. Jie Tang to research on an innovative topic about data mining in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Now, my research topic is about discovering topic evolution in scientific literature. 

I have been selected for an NGS Scholarship and I will be enrolled into the [NUS Graduate School for Integrative Sciences and Engineering (NGS)][NGS] for my PhD studies in [National University of Singapore][NUS] from January 2018. I hope to work with Prof. [Tat-Seng Chua][Chua] in the [NUS-Tsinghua Extreme Search Centre (NExT)][NExT] to follow my research interest as a Ph.D.
