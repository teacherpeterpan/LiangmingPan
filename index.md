# About Me

<img src="/images/liangmingpan2.jpg" class="floatpic" width="200" height="200">
My name is Liangming Pan. I am a research assistant in the Knowledge Engineering Lab (Group) at [Tsinghua University][Tsinghua] where I work with Prof. [Juanzi Li][juanzili] and Prof. [Jie Tang][jietang]. I received my Master degree from Tsinghua University under the guidance of Prof. Juanzi Li (2014 - 2017). And, before this, I was an undergraduate student of [Beihang University][BUAA] (2010 - 2014). 

My research interests include knowledge base, natrual language processing and data mining. When I was a master student, I devoted most of my time working with Prof. Jie Tang to research on an innovative topic about data mining in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Now, my research topic is about discovering topic evolution in scientific literatures. 

I have applied for a PhD. programme offered by the [School of Computing][SOC] in [National University of Singapore][NUS]. And I hope to work with Prof. [Tat-Seng Chua][Chua] in the [NUS-Tsinghua Extreme Search Centre (NExT)][NExT] to follow my research interset as a PhD.
