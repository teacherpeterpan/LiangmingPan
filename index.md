# About Me

<img src="/images/jasonansel3.jpg" class="floatpic" width="200" height="200">
My name is Jason Ansel.  I am a Director of Engineering at GoDaddy, which
I joined in 2013 as part of the [acquisition] of the startup [Locu][locu].
I started working for Locu in 2011, while I was simultaneously pursuing
my PhD at [MIT][MIT] [CSAIL][CSAIL], which I completed in 2013.  I was the
first non-founder employee of Locu and my work there and at GoDaddy focuses
on creating machine learning algorithms for extracting semantic information
from unstructured web content.

I spend some of my free time working on [OpenTuner], an extensible framework
for program autotuning.  We are currently looking for users, if interested
the source code is available on the [OpenTuner] site.

As part of my PhD dissertation, I started the [PetaBricks] language and
compiler project.  PetaBricks is a language that incorporates algorithmic
choices to allow an integrated autotuner to explore search spaces of program
implementations.  As an undergraduate I did research with [Gene Cooperman]
and helped create [DMTCP], a user-level distributed checkpoint/restart system.
